It presents users with a fictional world consisting of interactive elements that do not follow the usual principles of the interfaces people engage with on a daily basis. The experience provides a glimpse into a few of the events of 2020, indicating  the recent fissures in the indian context. The fictional world is created by the artist from the responses received by the users to the prompt '<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScvsRDk7P59dGPFM0-t0-U1s9XXVcLyJw9hz65p1gFXRVlOqw/viewform" target="_blank">What do you dream about?</a>'.<br><br>This artwork is created as part of ‘Fissure’ curated by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shaleenwadhwana/" target="_blank">Shaleen Wadhwana</a> for <a href="https://pollinator.io/virtual-nursery/" target="_blank">Virtual Nursery</a> (2020-21) by Pollinator&nbsp;</p><br><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Artist Statement</em></strong><br><br>Past experiences of media-based trophic cascades such as  swayed elections, mob lynching and economic disruption  have proven time and again that technology and media hold an unprecedented power to affect communities and their decision making. And as we enter this new decade, we are a little bit closer towards the grand vision of a digital singularity. So the lingering questions remain at the fringe. Is the idea of a digital singularity utopian or dystopian in nature? How do alternatives exist in the presence of a singularity? Or can we call this process towards singularity a way to colonize the decolonized?
<br><br>Fresh out of the Terraforming trip, as a Designer and Researcher, I became curious about the Indian context. What is the Indian context? I ask the question not just in terms of natural or artificial infrastructure but also the diversity of the meta and virtual reality constructed by the people. So, the question inherently becomes a question of identity. My initial proposal in response to the ‘Fissure’ - curatorial prompt by Virtual Nursery was about the geo aesthetics of fissure. During the past four months, the perspective through which I was trying to investigate the idea of the Indian context shifted from the external to the internal.
<br>Individuals make up any form of identity and looking back at history, the core of the Indian context seems to be mostly about multiplicity - juxtaposition of cultures, technology, and infrastructure over large and small periods of time.
<br><br>A baby is born. The kid dreams. And the person runs. Over time the individual actor’s meta, virtual and material reality evolve as does one’s position in the planetary sensorium or the planetary stack. As time is the only invariant in this ontological transformation of the individual context, dreams become an interesting lens to get some insights into the shifting context. For one, unlike the material and virtual reality, the meta reality often escapes the reflective archiving in the virtual reality. It’s all in one’s head. How do we capture something so abstract, something that is very fickle and diverse? <br>
<br>And such questions are what I try to explore via my artwork ‘Lost in a Dreamscape.’ Hence, I created a form asking people ‘What do you dream about?’. The form focused on the content that dreams are made of, artefacts from the plane of immanence, floating around in our subconscious. And using such artefacts, I created a dreamscape, an alternate universe that viewers can interact with. By treating the internet as a schizo medium and breaking out of the predefined norms of standardized user interactions, the experience attempts to create an alternate imagination of an interface that could exist but does not. <br>
<br>What do a dream, a maze and a doom scroll(endlessly scrolling through your social media feed) have in common? The process of getting lost despite the diversity of the medium ranging from the meta to the material to the virtual. Sometimes the individual is lost because of a lack of a final destination, and sometimes one is lost due to lack of direction to the desired destination. And it is okay to be lost, for the only way forward is through.&nbsp;<br><strong><em><br></em></strong></p><br><p><strong><em><br>Artist Bio</em></strong><br><br><a href="http://anidalal.net/" target="_blank">Ani Dalal</a> is a researcher/designer based in Bangalore.
